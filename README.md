# Mascagni

A homemade chess engine in rust. Work in progress.

## Getting started

```bash
cargo run
```
This will start a game in the terminal. Currently one input moves for both sides. Eventually, I hope to have the computer play for one side in a somewhat intelligent way.

## TODO

 - Repitition draws
 - True UCI compatibility
 - Perft
 - Search
 - Evaluation
